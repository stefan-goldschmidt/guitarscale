## Vibecoding Experiment

This project is a **Vibecoding** experiment. It was created to test and compare the capabilities of various Large Language Models (LLMs) in a real-world development scenario. The entire codebase, design, and logic were generated and refined through iterative prompting.

## Hosting

The project is designed to be hosted as a static site (e.g., GitHub Pages, Vercel, or Netlify). Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser to run it locally.
